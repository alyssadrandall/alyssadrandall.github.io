Why learn how to code? What's intriguing about software engineering?

For me, I was feeling stuck in life. I tend to see the bigger picture and how to improve anything in a company from a base level. Being on the frontline in sales in my last few jobs, all I could think about is what could be done in the background to make my and my coworker's jobs more streamlined and efficient while improving the customer's experience. Coding is an intriguing solution to better the background world in any business. 
 
I discovered Flatiron in a newsletter called the Morning Brew (awesome newsletter, by the way) and I tried the boot camp. I was instantly reminded of MySpace days where I got to build my own profile out of thin air and create something I was proud of. I hadn't realized the small piece of internet I built twelve years ago was applicable to so much more - specifically a world where I get to use my creativity and drive to build things that make everyone else's work and lives better. 

I co-founded a Drum Instruction and Holistic Living with Sound business with my partner Adam - Play Drums Now and Intuitive Rhythms. I am passionate about the ideas and science around how sound can help people heal. While this business is not off the ground yet, I'm thankful to learn software engineering before we launch entirely so the products/platform are up to par right out of the gates.

I am grateful to be on this new path. I feel like I finally found my niche - the type of work that makes me excited to get up every day and help to world improve - whether it's for me or my future employer. I'm happy to be here.
